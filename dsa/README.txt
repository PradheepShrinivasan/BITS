The folder contains Data structures and algorithms problems i did as part of the assignment. 

Short summary of the problems

q1 --> Contains a quick select algorithm to find the kth smallest element. The input is data in different bases.
       The code reads the input from different base and convert it to base 10 and performs finds the
       kth smallest element.

q2 --> Implements 3 hashing implementation(chaining, probing, quadratic probing) for the same dataset and 
       compares the collision to figure out the best hashing technique.
       
       
q3 --> Implements a graph coloring solution to a graph problem.
