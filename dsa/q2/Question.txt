Generate a hashtable for storing the Phone book data having the tuples (Name, phone
number, mail id).
For the initial hash, you may use the hash function defined as (sum of ASCII values of all
the characters in the name field ) modulo m, where m is the size of your hashtable.
Compare the performance of the hashtable if
a) separate chaining is used,
b) open addressing with linear probing is used,
c) open addressing with quadratic probing is used.
You must use the same data set for all three techniques, clearly indicating the maximum
and average number of accesses required to add/find an element in the hashtable.
Please use a sufficiently large data set (randomly generated) to test in this code.
The results that you observed must be provided in the README file in the directory.
