Compiling the code
===================

To compile the code just type "make" in the folder


Running the code
=================

To run the code type ./hashtable

Output of the code
==================

On running the code, the code reads the file names.txt and creates/adds the names
into 3 hash tables Chaining,LProbing and QProbing hash tables. 

The average/maximum/failed number of operations are also calculated. 

Also the same file is read and is used to search the names in the 3 hash tables 
and the average/maximum/failed number of operations are calculated

The output of the program is shown below

Observation
============

---------------------------------------------------------------- 
Insertion case - Total insertions 1219 in a hash table of 2000
 ---------------------------------------------------------------- 
 			Maximum number		Average number		failed cases
Chaining		14			2			0
LProbing		1122			323			0
QProbing		35			15			0
---------------------------------------------------------------- 
Searching case - Total searches 1219 in a hash table of 2000
---------------------------------------------------------------- 
			Maximum number		Average number		failed cases
Chaining		15			3			0
LProbing		1123			324			0
QProbing		36			16			0
---------------------------------------------------------------- 

File List
=========

Source/Data Files
